# React Color Toggle App


## Description
This is a simple React application that allows users to toggle between a white and black section with a button. It demonstrates the use of React hooks (`useState`) to manage the state of a background color and showcases how to dynamically change the UI based on user interactions.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState Hook**: React's hook for managing state in functional components.
- **CSS**: For styling the components and managing transitions.
- **npm**: A package manager to handle the projectâ€™s dependencies.


## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-color-toggle-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd react-color-toggle-app
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
To use the app, click the **Toggle Transition** button to switch between a white and black background section. The text and background color will change dynamically based on the state of the app.

## Customization

If you want to customize the app:

1. **Change the Colors**: Modify the background colors by editing the `.white` and `.black` classes in `App.css`.
   ```css
   .white {
     background-color: #ffffff;
     color: #000000;
   }

   .black {
     background-color: #000000;
     color: #ffffff;
   }
   ```

2. **Add More Sections**: To add more toggle-able sections, you can extend the `App.js` component and replicate the structure used for the white and black sections.
